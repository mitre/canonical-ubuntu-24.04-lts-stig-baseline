### INPUTS ###
# Inputs are variables that can be referenced by any control in the profile,
# and are defined and given a default value in this file.

# By default, each parameter is set to exactly comply with the profile baseline
# wherever possible. Some profile controls will require a unique value reflecting
# the necessary context for the supporting system.

# Values provided here can be overridden using an input file or a CLI flag at
# execution time. See InSpec's Inputs docs at https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/
# for details.

# NOTE: DO NOT directly change the default values by editing this file. Use
# overrides instead.
